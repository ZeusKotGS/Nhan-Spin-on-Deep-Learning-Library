# Nhan-Spin-on-Deep-Learning-Library

My own spin on a deep learning library.
Plans:
- Tensors
- Loss functions
- Basic Neural Network Skeletal Structure

I plan to add more functionalities as I learn more about Machine Learning and AI

I certainly want to add GANs and Transformers from scratch

What to improve:
- create own tensor class (GPU)
- add more loss functions
- add LSTM, Convlution, Recurrent
- add optimizers with momentum
